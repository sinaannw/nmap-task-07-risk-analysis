## üîé 192.168.1.1

### ‚úÖ Open Ports:
- **21/tcp (FTP)**  
  - **Risk**: Transmits data and credentials in plain text. Easily sniffed.
  - **Recommendations**: 
    - Disable if unused.
    - Replace with SFTP or FTPS.
    - Restrict IPs via firewall.

- **22/tcp (SSH)** ‚Äî *Filtered*  
  - **Risk**: Potential brute-force attack vector if reachable.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Use key-based authentication.
    - Use a non-standard port.
    - Monitor login attempts.

- **53/tcp (DNS)**  
  - **Risk**: Can be abused for DNS amplification attacks or information leakage.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Restrict to internal use.
    - Validate and secure zone transfers.

- **80/tcp (HTTP)**  
  - **Risk**: Unencrypted web traffic; may expose sensitive data.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Redirect to HTTPS.
    - Patch web server software.
    - Use WAF (Web Application Firewall).

- **443/tcp (HTTPS)**  
  - **Risk**: Secure but still may be vulnerable to misconfigurations (e.g., weak TLS).
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Use strong TLS ciphers.
    - Keep certificates up to date.
    - Run vulnerability scans on web apps.

## üîé 192.168.1.33

### ‚úÖ Open Ports:
- **49152/tcp (unknown)**  
  - **Risk**: High-numbered dynamic port ‚Äî could be used by custom or P2P apps.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Identify the service.
    - Restrict via firewall if unnecessary.

- **62078/tcp (iPhone sync / usbmuxd)**  
  - **Risk**: Exposes Apple sync services over the network.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Disable remote sync.
    - Block externally.
    - Use only via USB when needed.

## üîé 192.168.1.37

### ‚úÖ Open Ports:
- **8000/tcp (HTTP-alt)**  
  - **Risk**: Often used for dev/testing servers; may lack security hardening.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Don‚Äôt expose dev servers externally.
    - Add authentication and HTTPS.
    - Restrict access.

- **8089/tcp (unknown)**  
  - **Risk**: Uncommon port; may be used by Splunk or other local services.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Identify the service.
    - Disable or restrict unless needed.

# üìå Recommendations

- Block unused ports via host firewall or router.
- Run vulnerability scans on exposed services.
- Harden services with encryption and authentication.
- Monitor network for suspicious connections.
