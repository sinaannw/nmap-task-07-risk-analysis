# Task 07 - Risk Analysis of Open Ports

## üìå Objective

Analyze the open ports discovered during a TCP SYN scan on the local network (`192.168.1.0/24`) and identify potential security risks associated with those ports.

---

## üß™ What I Did

- Ran a SYN scan using Nmap:
  ```bash
  nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -oN scan_results.txt
Collected results from scan_results.txt.

Identified open ports on live hosts.

Researched common vulnerabilities and risks for those services.

Documented the risks and provided security recommendations in ports_analysis.md.
